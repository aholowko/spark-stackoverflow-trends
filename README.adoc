#### TRENDS ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ACCORDING TO DATASET FROM STACK OVERFLOW

The purpose of the thesis is trends analysis of programming languages according to dataset from Stack Overflow. 
It aims to recognize the most frequently used programming language used by software developers.

The analysis was conducted with use of Big Data techniques. 
The main part of data processing was accomplished with Apache Spark engine for large-scale data processing. 
The analyzed statistics are for example: number of questions concerning a programming language per month, number of developers answering questions about a programming language.

The obtained results were graphically presented with tools such as Python Pandas and Altair.
According to the presented analysis, the most popular programming languages among Stack Overflow users are 

. “JavaScript” (growing popularity), 
. “Java” (stable popularity), 
. “C#” (shrinking popularity).
